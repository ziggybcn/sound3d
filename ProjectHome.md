Sound3D is a BlitzMax module to provide real 3D sound to games being made with miniB3D. It works in a very similar way to the 3D sound routines that where present in B3D, but I've added some changes in order to benefit more of the OpenAL library.

This module is a forked version of the previous work made by **Klepto2** (_minisound3d_) and **Mark sibly** (_the OpenAL max driver_). However, this version has some differences on the classes design, has had several fixes and improvements, and let's you use some of the features OpenAL has (such as real per-entity doppler effect).

The name of this semi-new module is sound3D, It has been tested to work pretty well on latest minib3d version, and it's been released under the MIT license, so if anyone wants to join, change it, fork it or whatever, development is open!

It is more or less a finished work, but I will be happy to fix any issue that may appear.

To get it, it is highly recommended to use a SVN program and get latest version, becouse bundled downloads are not always up to date (and might be not 100% stable).

I just hope this is useful for the blitzers. More info here: http://code.google.com/p/sound3d/wiki/BriefIntroduction
